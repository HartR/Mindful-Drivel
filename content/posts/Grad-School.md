I was recently admitted to the computer science graduate program at San Diego State University. I'm very excited for the opporuntunity to continue my education in this field, which is somewhat surprising, given that I felt "completely done" with school when I graduated in 2014. However, in the past couple years, I found myself missing the study of the more math-y parts of computer science and have become interested in learning more about machine learning.

I'll be working a full time job, while pursuing the degree part time. Goodbye social life!

First day of classes is August 24th. Go Aztecs!
