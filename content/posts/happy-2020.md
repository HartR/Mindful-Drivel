I just want to wish everyone a Happy New Year.

2019 was a great year for me: 
* I started computer science graduate school and passed my first semester of classes
* I started dating an awesome girl
* I survived
* All my loved ones survived

2020 goals:
* I have resolutions of being a vegetarian for the whole year and staying off of time wasting sites (e.g. youtube, reddit)
* Continue to survive
* Continue to be grateful for the little things

Peace and prosperity to all
