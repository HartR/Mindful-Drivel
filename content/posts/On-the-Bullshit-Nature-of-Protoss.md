To be clear, I am not now, nor have I ever been, an active Starcraft II player. The highest rank I've ever achieved is [platinum](https://www.rankedftw.com/team/2280995/#td=world&ty=c&ra=best&tyz=0&tx=a&tl=1 "rankedftw: hortisimo"). Since the Wings of Liberty Beta, I have played a total of [insert number here] games.
